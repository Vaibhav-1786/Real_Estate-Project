## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or newer
- **Python** 3.11 or newer
- **MySQL** 8.0 (or MariaDB 10.6+)

### 1. Database

```bash
# Start MySQL/MariaDB, then create the schema:
mysql -u root -p < database/schema.sql

# Apply migrations, in order:
mysql -u root -p iconic_estates_india < database/migration_crm.sql
mysql -u root -p iconic_estates_india < database/migration_crm_p2.sql
mysql -u root -p iconic_estates_india < database/migration_crm_p3.sql
mysql -u root -p iconic_estates_india < database/migration_crm_p4.sql
mysql -u root -p iconic_estates_india < database/migration_crm_p5.sql
mysql -u root -p iconic_estates_india < database/migration_notifications.sql
mysql -u root -p iconic_estates_india < database/migration_property_media.sql
mysql -u root -p iconic_estates_india < database/migration_spam_status.sql

# Regenerate and load seed data (24 properties, 6 builders, experts, etc.)
python3 database/gen_seed.py
mysql -u root -p iconic_estates_india < database/seed.sql
```

For production, create a dedicated, least-privilege DB user instead of using
`root`:

```sql
CREATE USER 'iconic_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourSecurePassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON iconic_estates_india.* TO 'iconic_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### 2. Node API

```bash
cd backend-node
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the values below
npm install
npm run dev             # nodemon, or `npm start` for plain node
```

Fill in `backend-node/.env`:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME` | MySQL connection |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Signs admin session tokens |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | Admin token lifetime (e.g. `1d`) |
| `CUSTOMER_JWT_SECRET` | Signs customer-portal OTP session tokens (falls back to `JWT_SECRET` if unset — set a distinct value in production) |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_NAME` | Bootstrap admin account used by `npm run seed` |
| `PORT` | API port (default `5000`) |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated origins allowed by CORS |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | Directory for uploaded files (default `uploads/`) |
| `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURE`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Optional — enables outbound email (OTP delivery, CRM "Send Email"). Without these, OTPs are returned directly in the API response for local testing — see [Customer Portal](#customer-portal-passwordless-login) |

Seed the bootstrap admin account:

```bash
npm run seed
```

Runs on `http://localhost:5000`. Health check: `GET /health`.

### 3. Python analytics service

```bash
cd backend-python
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Runs on `http://localhost:8000`. Health check: `GET /health`. Interactive docs
at `http://localhost:8000/docs` (FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI).

Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in this service's environment (or a `.env` file, if you
add one) if the frontend or Node API run on non-default hosts/ports.

### 4. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Opens `http://localhost:3000`. Requests to `/api/*` are proxied to the Node API
on `http://localhost:5000` via the `proxy` field in `frontend/package.json`.
Calls to the analytics service (port `8000`) are made directly — check
`frontend/src/services/api.js` for the base URL and update it if you run that
service on a different host/port.

---

## Roles and Access

**Admin side** (`backend-node/middleware/auth.js`, email + password, JWT):

| Role | Access |
| --- | --- |
| `super_admin` | Full access, including creating new admin/agent accounts (`POST /api/auth/register`) and user management |
| `admin` | Properties, leads, inquiries, CRM, builders, experts, templates, market data, analytics |
| `agent` | Restricted to the routes each controller explicitly allows for agents |

**Customer side** (`backend-node/middleware/customerAuth.js`, mobile OTP, a
separate JWT): customers can only view and act on the lead/inquiry record tied
to their own verified mobile number — there is no customer role that can see
other customers' data.

---

## API Overview

**Node API** (`http://localhost:5000/api`):

| Route prefix | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| `/auth` | Admin login, registration (super admin only), current user, password change |
| `/properties` | Property listings and detail CRUD |
| `/leads` | Lead pipeline (New → Contacted → Qualified → Closed/Lost) |
| `/inquiries` | Contact/site-visit/callback inquiries, spam status |
| `/builders` | Builder directory |
| `/experts` | Civil engineers, interior/exterior designers |
| `/market` | Market intelligence data |
| `/crm` | Notes, customer detail, CRM actions |
| `/templates` | Outreach templates, CSV export |
| `/notifications` | In-app admin notifications |
| `/portal` | Customer portal — OTP auth, own records, messages, documents |
| `/analytics` | Dashboard metrics for the admin panel |

**Python analytics API** (`http://localhost:8000/api`):

| Route prefix | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| `/roi` | Investment ROI calculations |
| `/recommendations` | Property recommendations |
| `/market` | Market intelligence |
| `/journey` | Ownership journey / milestone tracking |

---

## Customer Portal (Passwordless Login)

The customer portal (`/portal` routes, `frontend/src/pages/portal/`) does not
use passwords. A customer requests an OTP with the mobile number they used on
a lead or inquiry; the system verifies that number is on file, generates a
6-digit code valid for 10 minutes, and emails it to the address associated
with that record if SMTP is configured (`backend-node/utils/mailer.js`).

**If SMTP is not configured**, `request-otp` returns the code directly in the
JSON response (clearly labeled) so the flow still works end-to-end during
local development. **Do not leave SMTP unconfigured in production** — see
[Security Notes](#security-notes).

---

## Building for Production

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build      # outputs to frontend/build/
```

Serve `frontend/build/` as static files behind your web server or CDN, run the
Node API under a process manager (PM2, systemd, Docker), and run the FastAPI
service with a production ASGI setup (e.g. `uvicorn` behind Gunicorn workers,
or Uvicorn directly with `--workers`).

Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` on **both** backends to your real production origins —
see [Security Notes](#security-notes) regarding the current CORS configuration
in `backend-node/server.js`.

---

## Security Notes

Please review these before deploying publicly (the vulnerability-reporting
process and a full production checklist are in **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**):

- **CORS currently reflects any origin.** `backend-node/server.js` configures
  CORS with `origin: true`, which allows requests from *any* origin (with
  credentials). This is convenient for local development across ports but
  should be replaced with an explicit allowlist built from
  `process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS` before deploying.
- **`.env` files are gitignored** (`backend-node/.env`, `*.env`) — verify they
  were never committed in your history, and rotate `JWT_SECRET`,
  `CUSTOMER_JWT_SECRET`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` if they ever were.
- **Set a distinct `CUSTOMER_JWT_SECRET`.** It silently falls back to
  `JWT_SECRET` if unset, which means a leaked customer-portal token secret
  would also compromise admin sessions. Set both, and set them differently.
- **OTPs are returned in the API response when SMTP isn't configured.** This
  is intentional for local development (see above) but is a real
  authentication bypass if left enabled in production. Confirm SMTP is
  configured, and consider gating the `dev_otp` field behind
  `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` explicitly if it isn't already.
- **Rate limiting is in place** for the general API (300 req/15 min) and login
  (10 req/10 min) via `express-rate-limit` — review these thresholds against
  your expected traffic before going live.
- **File uploads** are handled by `multer` (`backend-node/middleware/upload.js`)
  and served statically from `/uploads`. Confirm file-type/size validation
  meets your requirements before accepting uploads from the public internet.
- **Bootstrap admin credentials** (`ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`)
  are used only by `npm run seed` to create the first `super_admin` account —
  change the password immediately after first login, and remove/rotate the
  `.env` values afterward if you don't plan to reseed.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Frontend can't reach the API.**
Confirm the Node API is running on port `5000` (or update the `proxy` field in
`frontend/package.json`), and that `backend-node/.env` has valid DB credentials.

**Analytics charts on the admin dashboard are empty.**
Confirm the FastAPI service is running on port `8000` and reachable from the
browser — it's called directly by the frontend, not proxied through Node.

**OTP login says "No enquiry found."**
The customer portal only issues OTPs for mobile numbers already present on a
`leads` or `inquiries` record. Submit a contact/site-visit enquiry with that
number first, or add it via the admin panel.

**"Insufficient privileges" when creating a new admin user.**
`POST /api/auth/register` requires the `super_admin` role — `admin` and
`agent` accounts cannot create new users.

**Migrations fail with a missing table/column error.**
Run `database/schema.sql` first, then the `migration_*.sql` files in the order
listed in [Getting Started](#1-database) — several depend on tables created by
earlier migrations.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. For larger changes please open an issue first, keep database
migrations additive and in order, and never commit secrets (`.env` files, JWT secrets, SMTP
passwords) or real customer data.
